# Thesis-Project-Emotion-Embeddings
Two experiments testing the effect of training data restriction on the accuracy of StrengthNet (Liu et al., 2021) and Zhu et al. (2019)

The three different models can be found in their respective three folders. The code to train StrengthNet can be found in StrengthNet Scripts/train.py. This folder also contains the trained StrengthNet models. The code to train both the Zhu models as well as the lexical diversity task model can be found in the Rank_SVM.ipnynb file. In order to train the models, the ESD must be file structure preprocessed by running file_mover.py. The ESD dataset itself can be found here: [ESD](https://github.com/HLTSingapore/Emotional-Speech-Data). Test data files for all SVM models are included in the Test Data SVM subfolder as four_{emotion}.py for all emotion categories and for the StrengthNet model as audio files in sNet Test.
